<!-- Dot 1, lang: r ------------------------------------------------>

```{block, Dot = 1, part = "Instruction", lang = "r"}
This Dotto describes how to create animation in R using the **gganimate** R package.

gganimate is an extension of the ggplot2 package for creating animated ggplots. It provides a range of new functionality that can be added to the plot object in order to customize how it should change with time.

Key features of gganimate:

- **transitions**: you want your data to change
- **views**: you want your viewpoint to change
- **shadows**: you want the animation to have memory

gganimate stable version is available on CRAN and can be installed with `install.packages('gganimate')`. The latest development version can be installed as follow: `devtools::install_github('thomasp85/gganimate')`.

```

```{r, Dot = 1, part = "Code", echo = T, eval = F, }
# Load required packages and set theme:
library(ggplot2)
library(gganimate)
theme_set(theme_bw())

# demo dataset
library(gapminder)
head(gapminder)

```

```{r, Dot = 1, part = "Result", echo = F, eval = T}
# Load required packages and set theme:
library(ggplot2)
library(gganimate)
theme_set(theme_bw())

# demo dataset
library(gapminder)
head(gapminder)

```


<!-- Dot 2, lang: r ------------------------------------------------>

```{block, Dot = 2, part = "Instruction", lang = "r"}

```

```{r, Dot = 2, part = "Code", echo = T, eval = F, }

```

```{r, Dot = 2, part = "Result", echo = F, eval = T}

```


<!-- Dot 3, lang: r ------------------------------------------------>

```{block, Dot = 3, part = "Instruction", lang = "r"}

```

```{r, Dot = 3, part = "Code", echo = T, eval = F, }

```

```{r, Dot = 3, part = "Result", echo = F, eval = T}

```
